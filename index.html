    <p>I would like to go back to Japan just for the food. I am really desperate. Some of the food I really miss are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ramen</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ohsho.co.jp/menu/west/post_395.html" title="GyozaNoOsho" target="_blank">fried rice</a></li>
      <li>gyoza</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and there are so much more...Although I am desperate to go back to Japan just for the food, I am also willing to improve my cooking skills for cooking Italian dishes. Comparing the price of the products at the supermarket, maybe Japan has more products that are cheaper for the quality. The food here in Italy are mostly good in quality and take a generous amount of money for it.</p>
